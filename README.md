r00t is a Discord bot bringing utility and function to your server.

## You're here to see the code, right?
Our team worked really hard bringing our lil robo friend R00T to life. Please dont rip our code and display it as your own creation. This open source code is meant for servers who might have some security concerns. This shows them exactly what the bot will do on their server, and how.

## Server owner?
Invite the bot to your server [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=817489848628936704&permissions=8&scope=bot). Mention the bot to see the prefix. The prefix in the state of creation is `#`
